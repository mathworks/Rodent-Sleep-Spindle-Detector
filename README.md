### System Requirements

[Operating System requirements](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/previous-releases.html)

## Getting started

### Description

The multi-window Rodent Sleep Spindle Detector app can identify sleep spindles within intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Periods of quiescence can optionally be identified via video recordings to improve sleep spindle detection. The program includes validation methods to compare detected results to a ground truth.


### Workflow

1. Open the app after installation.
2. Open EEG and/or video of a rodent
3. Use sliders or their respective edit fields to adjust the time, epoch, zoom, binary threshold, and area threshold.
4. Click the Analyze button or File>Analyze in the menu to analyze the entire EEG and generate a spreadsheet of results.

Validation (Optional)

5. Select the Validation tab
6. Click "Load GroundTruth"
7. Click "Calculate"
