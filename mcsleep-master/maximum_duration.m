function [DD,begins,ends] = maximum_duration(DD,begins,ends,max_dur,fs)
% MAXIMUM_DURATION - checks the sample duration of the spindles.
% Input is a vector containing ones in the interval where the spindle is
% and indexs describing the start and end of the spindle. The last two
% inputs are the maximum duration given in seconds and the sampling
% frequency given in Hz.
% Output is a vector containing ones in the interval where the spindle with
% duration shorter than or equal to the maximum duration is and indexs
% describing the start and end of the spindle.
